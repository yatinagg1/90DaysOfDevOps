# Day 27 – GitHub Profile Makeover: Build Your Developer Identity

## Task

Your GitHub profile is your **developer resume**. Recruiters, hiring managers, and open-source maintainers will look at your GitHub before your LinkedIn. Today, you'll clean up your profile, organize your repositories, and create a profile README that tells your story.

This is not a coding day — it's a **branding day**. Treat it seriously.

---

## Expected Output
- A polished GitHub profile with a profile README
- Well-organized repositories with proper names, descriptions, and READMEs
- A markdown file: `day-27-notes.md` documenting what you changed and why

---

## Challenge Tasks

### Task 1: Audit Your Current GitHub Profile
Before making changes, assess where you stand:
1. Visit your own GitHub profile as if you were a stranger — what impression does it give?
2. Answer in your notes:
   - Is your profile picture professional?
   - Is your bio filled in? Does it say what you do?
   - Are your pinned repos relevant, or are they random forks?
   - Do your repos have descriptions, or are they blank?
   - Would a recruiter understand what you've been working on?

---

### Task 2: Create Your Profile README
1. Create a **special repository** with the same name as your GitHub username (e.g., `github.com/yourname/yourname`)
2. Add a `README.md` — this will appear on your profile page
3. Include the following in your profile README:
   - A short introduction — who you are, what you're learning
   - What you're currently working on (e.g., 90 Days of DevOps)
   - Skills/tools you know or are learning (Linux, Git, Python, Shell, etc.)
   - Links to your important repos
   - How to reach you (LinkedIn, Twitter, email — whatever you're comfortable sharing)
4. Keep it clean and simple — don't overload it with badges and widgets

---

### Task 3: Organize Your Repositories
Create and organize the following repos (if you don't have them already):

1. **90 Days of DevOps** — your fork or personal repo with all daily submissions
   - Clear README explaining what the challenge is
   - Organized folder structure by day

2. **Shell Scripts** — a dedicated repo for all your shell scripting work
   - Move/copy your scripts from Days 16–21 here
   - Add a README listing what each script does

3. **Python Scripts** — a dedicated repo for your Python projects
   - Move/copy your scripts from Days 7–15 here
   - Add a README listing what each script does

4. **DevOps Notes** — a repo for your learning notes, cheat sheets, and references
   - Add your shell scripting cheat sheet (Day 21)
   - Add your git-commands.md
   - Organize by topic (Linux, Git, Python, etc.)

For **every repo**, make sure you have:
- A clear, descriptive **repo name** (use hyphens, not spaces — e.g., `shell-scripts` not `Shell Scripts`)
- A one-line **description** on GitHub
- A proper **README.md** explaining what's inside
- A relevant `.gitignore`

---

### Task 4: Pin Your Best Repos
1. Go to your GitHub profile and select **6 pinned repositories**
2. Choose repos that best represent your work and learning
3. Make sure each pinned repo has a description and README

---

### Task 5: Clean Up
1. Delete or archive repos that are empty, abandoned, or irrelevant
2. Rename any repos with unclear names
3. Make sure you're not exposing any secrets (`.env` files, API keys, passwords) in any repo — check your commit history too

---

### Task 6: Before & After
1. Take a screenshot of your GitHub profile **before** you started today
2. Take a screenshot **after** all your changes
3. Add both to your `day-27-notes.md`
4. Write 3 things you improved and why

---

## Tips for a Good Profile README
- Keep it **short** — 15-20 lines max
- Use headers and bullet points — don't write paragraphs
- Show what you're **doing**, not just what you **know**
- A few well-placed badges are fine, but don't turn it into a Christmas tree
- Look at profiles you admire for inspiration — but make yours authentic

---

## Submission
1. Add your `day-27-notes.md` (with before/after screenshots) to `2026/day-27/`
2. Share the link to your updated GitHub profile
3. Push to your fork
