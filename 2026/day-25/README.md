# Day 25 – Git Reset vs Revert & Branching Strategies

## Task

You'll learn how to **undo mistakes** safely — one of the most important skills in Git. You'll also explore **branching strategies** used by real engineering teams to manage code at scale.

---

## Expected Output
- A markdown file: `day-25-notes.md` with your observations and answers
- Continue updating `git-commands.md` in your `devops-git-practice` repo

---

## Challenge Tasks

### Task 1: Git Reset — Hands-On
1. Make 3 commits in your practice repo (commit A, B, C)
2. Use `git reset --soft` to go back one commit — what happens to the changes?
3. Re-commit, then use `git reset --mixed` to go back one commit — what happens now?
4. Re-commit, then use `git reset --hard` to go back one commit — what happens this time?
5. Answer in your notes:
   - What is the difference between `--soft`, `--mixed`, and `--hard`?
   - Which one is destructive and why?
   - When would you use each one?
   - Should you ever use `git reset` on commits that are already pushed?

---

### Task 2: Git Revert — Hands-On
1. Make 3 commits (commit X, Y, Z)
2. Revert commit Y (the middle one) — what happens?
3. Check `git log` — is commit Y still in the history?
4. Answer in your notes:
   - How is `git revert` different from `git reset`?
   - Why is revert considered **safer** than reset for shared branches?
   - When would you use revert vs reset?

---

### Task 3: Reset vs Revert — Summary
Create a comparison in your notes:

| | `git reset` | `git revert` |
|---|---|---|
| What it does | ? | ? |
| Removes commit from history? | ? | ? |
| Safe for shared/pushed branches? | ? | ? |
| When to use | ? | ? |

---

### Task 4: Branching Strategies
Research the following branching strategies and document each in your notes with:
- How it works (short description)
- A simple diagram or flow (text-based is fine)
- When/where it's used
- Pros and cons

1. **GitFlow** — develop, feature, release, hotfix branches
2. **GitHub Flow** — simple, single main branch + feature branches
3. **Trunk-Based Development** — everyone commits to main, short-lived branches
4. Answer:
   - Which strategy would you use for a startup shipping fast?
   - Which strategy would you use for a large team with scheduled releases?
   - Which one does your favorite open-source project use? (check any repo on GitHub)

---

### Task 5: Git Commands Reference Update
Update your `git-commands.md` to cover everything from Days 22–25:
- Setup & Config
- Basic Workflow (add, commit, status, log, diff)
- Branching (branch, checkout, switch)
- Remote (push, pull, fetch, clone, fork)
- Merging & Rebasing
- Stash & Cherry Pick
- Reset & Revert

---

## Hints
- `git reflog` is your safety net — it shows everything Git has done, even after a hard reset
- For branching strategies, look at how projects like Kubernetes, React, or Linux kernel manage branches

---

## Submission
1. Add your `day-25-notes.md` to `2026/day-25/`
2. Update `git-commands.md` — commit and push
3. Push to your fork
